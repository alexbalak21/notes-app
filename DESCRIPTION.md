- **Purpose**: Manages application theme
- **Features**:
  - Persists theme preference in localStorage
  - Provides theme and toggle function to all components
- **Hook**: `useTheme()` - returns `{ theme, toggleTheme }`

### Local State
- Most components use React's `useState` for local state management
- State lifting is used to share state between parent and child components
- Form state is managed locally within form components

## Styling

- **Material-UI**: Components are styled using Material-UI's `sx` prop and `styled` API
- **Theming**: Custom theme configuration in `theme.js`
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Material-UI's `useMediaQuery` and breakpoints

- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Theme preference is saved in localStorage
- Smooth transitions between themes

### 2. Note Management
- **Create**: Add new notes with title, content, and category
- **Read**: View notes in a responsive grid/list
- **Update**: Edit existing notes
- **Delete**: Remove notes with confirmation

### 3. Search and Filter
- Search notes by title or content
- Filter notes by category
- Combine search and filter for precise results

### 4. Category Management
- Create new categories with custom colors
- Assign categories to notes
- Filter notes by category

### 5. Responsive Design
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Optimized touch targets for mobile devices

## Component Interactions

1. **Adding a Note**:
   - User clicks "Add Note" button
   - `AddNote` modal opens
   - User fills in details and submits
   - New note appears in the grid

2. **Searching Notes**:
   - User types in search bar
   - `SearchBar` debounces input
   - `Home` component filters notes based on search term

3. **Filtering by Category**:
   - User selects a category from `SelectBar`
   - `Home` component filters notes by selected category

4. **Theme Toggling**:
   - User clicks theme toggle button
   - `ThemeContext` updates the theme
   - All components re-render with new theme

## Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Focus management for modals and dialogs

## Performance Considerations
- Memoized components with `React.memo`
- Debounced search input
- Lazy loading for routes
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## Dependencies
- React 18
- Material-UI (MUI) v5
- React Router DOM
- Axios for API calls
- date-fns for date formatting

## Future Improvements
1. Add note archiving
2. Implement note sharing
3. Add rich text editing
4. Support for note tags
5. Offline support with service workers
